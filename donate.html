    <p>As much as we want to think otherwise, making fun software stuff cost money. Teenagers like us normally don't get enough money to cover the costs of the technogical stuff that we need. So we ask all of our supporters and users to help us by donating money. By donating you can help us build the games and resources you love to play and use.</p>
    
    <h3>Donate what you got :P</h3>
